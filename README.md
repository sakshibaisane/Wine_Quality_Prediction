# Wine_Quality_Prediction
This project focuses on predicting wine quality based on its chemical characteristics using machine learning. We apply classification algorithms such as Random Forest, SGD, and SVC to predict wine quality scores. The task includes exploratory data analysis, model evaluation, and feature importance analysis to provide actionable insights.
